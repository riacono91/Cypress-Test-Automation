# Test Plan: Validating Cypress.io Example Site

## Objective

The objective of this test plan is to validate key features of the Cypress.io example site using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Gherkin syntax. The focus is on demonstrating the ability to automate user interactions like form submissions, login flows, and button clicks.

## Scope

This test plan covers the following key features:

1. **Form Interaction**: Testing text input fields, dropdowns, and radio buttons.
2. **Login Flow**: Verifying login behavior and handling alert messages.
3. **UI Interaction**: Testing basic button clicks and page navigation.

## Test Cases

### 1. Form Interaction

#### Scenario: Filling out form fields
Given the user is on the "Actions" page  
When the user types an email address into the email field  
And the user selects an option from the dropdown  
And the user clicks a radio button  
Then the form fields should be correctly filled and reflect the appropriate values.

### 2. Login Flow

#### Scenario: Invalid login attempt
Given the user is on the "Actions" page  
When the user clicks the login button with incorrect login credentials  
Then an alert message should appear indicating that the login is invalid.

### 3. UI Interaction

#### Scenario: Navigating to another page after clicking a button
Given the user is on the "Actions" page  
When the user clicks the "type" button  
Then the page should navigate to the "Actions" page showing the corresponding content.

## Tools Used

1. **Cypress**: For automating functional tests and verifying UI behavior.
2. **Gherkin**: For defining test scenarios using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodology.
3. **Browser Developer Tools**: For verifying layout, styles, and responsiveness.

## Success Criteria

1. **Test Coverage**: All core UI interactions should be tested, including form inputs, buttons, and alerts.
2. **Execution Time**: Tests should execute quickly without delays.
3. **Accuracy**: Tests should pass consistently across multiple test runs.
